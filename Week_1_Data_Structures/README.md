# Week 1 – Data Structures (JavaScript / MERN)

**Goal:** Understand how data is stored, accessed, and connected. Focus on Arrays, Objects/Maps, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Set.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. Arrays
2. Objects / Maps
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Linked List
6. Set

## 🧠 Mental Models

| Structure | Visualization | MERN Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Array | Boxes in a row | Rotate banners, paginate products |
| Object / Map | Hash box | Cart lookup (productID → quantity) |
| Stack | Plates piled up | Undo/Redo in admin panel |
| Queue | Line of people | Order processing, notifications |
| Linked List | Nodes with arrows | Scrollable playlist or product carousel |
| Set | Bucket of unique items | Track unique buyers/tags |

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `Arrays/` → Array concepts + examples  
- `Objects_Maps/` → Key-value structures  
- `Stack/` → LIFO operations  
- `Queue/` → FIFO operations  
- `LinkedList/` → Node-based structures  
- `Set/` → Unique collections

## ⚒️ Practice Strategy

- Read concept → Draw mental model → Code examples → Solve 2–3 exercises → Apply in MERN project feature
